# Wrapper for Intel Fortran compiler 10.x
# The ifort version 10.x compilers have a problem with not placing the 
# --start_group and --end_group flags correctly when calling ld.
# This happens when ifort is called with only .o and .a files (for pure
# linking), but not when there is also a .F file on the command line.
