       lockpack - lock packs

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mlockpack 22m[ 1m-f 22m] [ 4mpack124m ] [ 4mpack224m ]	...

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       For  a  single pack or a set of packs, 1mlockpack 22mrecursively removes all
       the "object" files (ie with extension "o" or "ok"), except those	 which
       are  used  individually	at linking time. The remaining files will have
       permissions changed to readonly.
       This command should be run once a pack has been finalized, so  that  it
       will  take  less	 disk  space. "Locked" packs can be considered as com‐
       pletely safe by end users, since they could not be changed later.
       Arguments are optional and can be a list	 of  packs  names  (directory)
       visible from the current directory.
       When  invoked without argument, the working directory can be any direc‐
       tory inside a pack.
