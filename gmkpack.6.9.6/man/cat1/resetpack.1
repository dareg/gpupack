1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mresetpack 22mremove all the control files managing the compilation  within
       a  single  pack	or a set of packs. Since 1mgmkpack 22mis supposed to manage
       the source code in a clever way (ie : check and do not re-make  control
       files if they are up to date, in an attempt to save time), this command
       could be useful in case of a failure, or to make sure  the  compilation
       will restart from scratch.
       Arguments  are  optional	 and  can be a list of packs names (directory)
       visible from the current directory.
       When invoked without argument, the working directory can be any	direc‚Äê
       tory inside a pack.
