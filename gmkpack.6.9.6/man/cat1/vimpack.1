1mNAME0m
       vimpack - navigate and edit files within a pack

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mvimpack 4m22m[24m 4m-i24m 4m]24m 4m[24m 4m-d24m 4m]24m 4m[filename]0m

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mvimpack 22mis a navigator/editor for packs, based on vim.
       It  requires  a	version	 of vim compiled with the embedded Perl inter‐
       preter available in your PATH.
       1mvimpack 22menables you to navigate in the source code, edit files and save
       your  modifications  without  caring about the branches of code in your
       pack.

       1mvimpack  22mshould be run always from the root directory of a pack.
       The first time you run it, 1mvimpack  22mcreates an  index  file.   You	may
       create  explicitely  this  index by running 'vimpack -i' the first time
       you invoke 1mvimpack  22m; otherwise it will  be	 automatically	created	 as
       soon as necessary. The creation of this index file may take a couple of
       minutes.

       To edit a file, invoke it with 1mvimpack	 22m; For instance :

	    vimpack cnt4.F90

       This  will edit the last version of this file. If  you  modify  it  and
       save it, it will be saved automatically in the 'local' directory of the
       pack.
       It is possible to commit temporary edited files using  the  command  :C
       from the editor window.	Writing a temporary file (using :w) will auto‐
       matically commit the file if it has been modified.

       To navigate, move the cursor on a word and press <TAB>.
       To go back, press <BACKSPACE>.

       To dive directly from a subroutine (or a module or a defined  type)  to
       another	one  called  by it (or a USE statement or a declaration state‐
       ment), move the cursor on its name and press <Â²> or <Å>.
       If this definition is not found, then the ordinary search results  will
       be displayed.

       To  search  for a word, use the command :F from the editor window ; for
       instance :

	    :F MYPROC

       The text research is such that :
       - case are insensitive
       - strings and comments are taken into acount
       - keywords are searched as well

       If the cursor is over a word, this word can be looked up using <TAB> as
       well.

       When  viewing  a	 search result, it is possible to jump to a particular
       location : just move the cursor to a file name or  a  line  number  and
       press <TAB>.

       To  edit a file in 'diff' mode (assuming this file has been modified in
       an intermediate or local pack), invoke 1mvimpack	 22mwith the  option  -d  ;
       example :


	    vimpack -d cnt0.F90

       List of commands from the editor window :

       :F 4mstring24m	     Finds all occurrences of 4mstring24m in the code.
       :C		Commit a temporary file (if modified) to src/local.
       :Cq		Commit to src/local (if file was modified) and exit.
       :E 4mfilename24m	     Edit 4mfilename0m
       :D		Difference of the current file with the N-1 version.
       <TAB>		Search for the word under the cursor.
       <Â²>		  Search  for  entity  definition and dive to it (when
       possible).
       <Å>		same as <Â²>
       <BACKSPACE>	Go back in the history.
       :NF 4mnewfilename24m  Edit a new file named  4mnewfilename24m  in  the  directory
       src/local
       <SHIFT-TAB>	Same as <TAB> but in an new split window
       :help vimpack	On-line help
