1mNAME0m
       cleanpack - remove object files and related in a pack.

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mcleanpack 22m[ 1m-f 22m]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mcleanpack  22mrecursively removes from the current directory and below all
       the files which are object files as interpreted by 1mgmkpack22m, that is all
       files  with  extension  "o",  "mod" or "ok", and all intermediate files
       generated by ODB.
       Precompilers, auto-generated interface blocs, object libraries and exe‐
       cutables	 are removed as well, though they are not in a subdirectory of
       the current one (they are removed because they are a  sub-product  from
       the source-code).
       Other hidden files are not removed.
       The  working directory can be any directory of the pack. But if it is a
       subdirectory of the  general  source  code  directory,  then  only  the
       source-code below will be cleaned (the cleaning works recursively down‐
       wards but not upwards). However, precompilers, auto-generated interface
       blocs, object libraries and executables would be removed anyway.
       1mclearpack22m.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       This command will not work if the current directory does not look  like
       the inside of a pack. Then the following message would be displayed :
       "The  working directory looks neither like the main directory of a pack
       nor the inside of a pack. No clean."
