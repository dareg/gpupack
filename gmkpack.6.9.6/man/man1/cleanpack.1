.SH NAME
cleanpack \- remove object files and related in a pack.
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cleanpack
[
.B -f
]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cleanpack
recursively removes from the current directory and below all the files which are
object files as interpreted by 
.B gmkpack\fR,
that is all files with extension "o", "mod" or "ok", and all intermediate files
generated by ODB.
.br
Precompilers, auto-generated interface blocs, object libraries and executables
are removed as well, though they are not in a subdirectory of the current one
(they are removed because they are a sub-product from the source-code).
.br
Other hidden files are not removed.
.br
The working directory can be any directory of the pack. But if it is a
subdirectory of the general source code directory, then only the source-code
below will be cleaned (the cleaning works recursively downwards but not
upwards). However, precompilers, auto-generated interface blocs, object
libraries and executables would be removed anyway.
.br Be aware not to mistake this command with
.B clearpack\fR.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-f\fR
By default,
.B cleanpack
asks for confirmation before running. Use this option to force the cleaning
without confirmation.
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
This command will not work if the current directory does not look like the
inside of a pack. Then the following message would be displayed :
.br
"The working directory looks neither like the main directory of a pack nor the
inside of a pack. No clean."
