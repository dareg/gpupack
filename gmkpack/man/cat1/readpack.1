1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mreadpack 22m[ 4mvariable24m ]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mreadpack  22mdisplays	either the whole configuration file used by 1mgmkpack0m
       or only the variable given as argument.

1mENVIRONNEMENT0m
       GMKFILE
	      The basename of the configuration file used to run 1mgmkpack22m.

       GMK_OPT
	      The extension name of the configuration file used	 to  run  1mgmk‐0m
	      1mpack22m.

1mDIAGNOSTICS0m
       The development of the option 1m-l 22mof 1mgmkpack 22mhas partly broken this com‐
       mand. For now, to make it work one has to be either in the  top	direc‐
       tory  of	 a  pack,  or  have  at least the environment variable GMKFILE
       exported. The environment variable GMK_OPT should be exported as	 well,
       unless the default value (x) is correct.
